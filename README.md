# Animal Classification 🐾

A machine learning project to classify animal species from images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and optional Transfer Learning (e.g. VGG16, ResNet, MobileNet) built with TensorFlow/Keras (or your chosen framework).


---

## 🚀 Overview

This repository trains a multi-class image classifier to identify various animal species (e.g. Bear, Bird, Cat, Dog, Elephant, Lion, Tiger, Zebra – adjust to your own dataset). It covers:
- Data loading and augmentation
- Model architecture design (CNN, Transfer Learning)
- Model training, validation and evaluation
- Prediction interface (script or notebook)

---

## 📦 Dataset

- Organize your dataset in subfolders-  one folder per animal class.
- Ensure images are resized (e.g. 224×224) and normalized appropriately.

## ⚙️ Workflow and Methodology

1. **Data loading and preprocessing**  
   Use `tf.keras.utils.image_dataset_from_directory()` or similar to load and batch datasets. Include augmentation steps such as flips, rotations, zooms.

2. **Model architecture**  
   - From-scratch CNN: Conv → Pool → BatchNorm → Dropout → Dense → Softmax  
   - Transfer Learning (optional): freeze feature extractor (e.g. VGG16, ResNet), add classifier head

3. **Training**  
   - Use appropriate loss (`sparse_categorical_crossentropy` or `categorical_crossentropy`) and optimizer (e.g. Adam)  
   - Monitor validation accuracy, use early stopping or checkpoints

4. **Evaluation**  
   - Plot training/validation loss and accuracy  
   - Compute confusion matrix, classification report (precision, recall, F1-score)

5. **Prediction**  
   - `predict.py` accepts a new image and outputs predicted class and confidence score

## 🛠️ Quick Start

  ### Prerequisites
  
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt


# ➡️Interpretation
- Discuss challenges like class imbalance, overfitting, and potential remedies via augmentation or more advanced architectures.

- Visualize misclassified examples and confusion matrix to interpret model behavior.
